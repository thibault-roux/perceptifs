# in this analyze, we will check how much humans agree with the majority instead of with each other

# we analyze the choice of humans given 1000 triplets (i.e. a reference, and two hypothesis). Each human evaluate 50 triplets. 
# The dataset is splitted in 20 sets.

# in folder ./data, there are files in this format:
#   min_0-1.json
#   min_0-2.json
#   min_0-3.json
#   min_0-4.json
#   min_1-1.json
#   min_1-2.json
#   min_1-3.json
#   min_1-4.json
#   min_2-1.json
#   min_2-2.json
#   ...
#   min_19-763686.json

# each file is a json file, containing choices of one human. The format is the following:
# {
#		 "name": "Paul Dupond",
#		 "age": "25",
#		 "language": "FranÃ§ais",
#		 "nbOfLanguages": "2",
#		 "educationLevel": "5",
